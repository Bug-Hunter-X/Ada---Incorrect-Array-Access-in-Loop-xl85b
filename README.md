This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: incorrect access to array elements within a loop. The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides the corrected version.  The error involves attempting to treat the entire array as a single value within a conditional statement, rather than accessing individual elements using the array index.  This leads to a compilation error or unexpected results at runtime. The solution clarifies proper array indexing and iteration techniques in Ada.
